### Hey there! I am [@jean-n92](https://github.com/jean-n92) (Gian is my call name).

I am a data engineer and (wannabe) software developer, and I am currently working for **[@ABNAMRO](https://github.com/ABNAMRO)**.

I mainly work with 📘 **[python](https://github.com/python/)** / **[cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)** and 📘 **[scala](https://github.com/scala/)** / **[scala](https://github.com/scala/scala)**, along with all surrounding technologies and CI/CD tools that usually go hand in hand with the DevOps framework (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI, SonarQube, Docker, etc). I am currently investigating cloud technologies (mainly Microsoft Azure and AWS) and their services in order to implement a distributed datawarehouse architecture.
During my free time:
- I try to use what brainpower I have left to learn things about completely unrelated languages, coz I love to hurt myself;
- I cry in a corner 'cause my contributions on GitHub suck, and I never have time for it.

Cya around, folks! 🖖🏻
