### Hey there! I am [@jean-n92](https://github.com/jean-n92) and Gian is my call name.
#### I am a DevOps engineer and I am currently working for **[Kaiko](http://kaiko.ai/)**, located in the beautiful **[Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam)**.

#### Development
Currently, I mainly work with [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) and [scala](https://github.com/scala/scala), along with many of the known packages (e.g. [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit), [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox), [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint), etc.) and technologies (e.g. [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/), [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)) that usually go hand in hand with the CI/CD workflow.
#### Infrastructure
When it comes to infrastructure, I tend to script with both [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/), leveraging either [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) or [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) to get a unit testing framework and spare a lot of debugging-related headaches. Moreover, I am usually an advocate for the infrastructure-as-code approach (via [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) or [bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep)) and containerization (via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)). On the latter, my guiding principle is always the [Twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net/).
#### Current job
I am currently working on the ‚òÅÔ∏è ([Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)) where I maintain and enhance a big distributed (internal) data warehouse for the Risk Data & Modelling department.
#### Random info
Currently __learning__ **[microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/)/[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)** and **[golang](https://github.com/golang/)/[go](https://github.com/golang/go)**   
Favourite __IDE__ is the one and only **[microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/)/[vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)**   
Despite I live in Amsterdam, my __hometown__ is **[Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome)**   

Live long and prosper! üññüèª
